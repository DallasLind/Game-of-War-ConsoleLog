# Game-of-War-ConsoleLog

### Game Concept
The game for this project is inspired by War in which the goal is to take all of the cards from the other player. There's no skill involved as it's dictated by the shuffle of the cards. To pull from the description of the game from [Wikipedia](https://github.com/DallasLind/Game-of-War-ConsoleLog): 

"The objective of the game is to win all of the cards.

The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck—this is a "battle"—and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. Aces are high, and suits are ignored.

If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war".Both players place the next card of their pile face down (some variants have three face down cards) and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's."

### Challenges
This was my first project from the ground-up utilizing Javascript without a strict tutorial, so attempting to put it together was already challenging. I feel as if I'm at a point where I understand how the syntax and concept works, but it's the putting it together cohesively with a programmtic mindset that continue to trips me up. If you have suggestions on how to improve it or what I should've done, don't hesitate to reach out! 

### Future Plans
* Make it fully functional
* Add scoring 
* Add rounds
* Maybe potentially add an interface with CSS and more involved HTML
* Flesh out my classes in the project to avoid having floating variables per the prompt.
